## For UX
* For the body, I used an image of a football theme that goes well with the foreground color I have chosen, which is a mixture of these colors (#183153, #892be2) and you can find all the colors I used on the website below in the reference sectionðŸ‘‡.

## Future Feather

* If the user enters the wrong answer, the correct answer will be displayed to them.

## Credits
  I did not find HTML and CSS too challenging since I had some experience with them and received some assistance from Slack, tutor support and W3school. However, Javascript was quite challenging even though I was familiar with the basics of js before I joined the course. Still, I needed help from outside sources, such as YouTube and Udemy. You can find more information by clicking on the links below 
* ### JS Code
  * The quiz information overlay page was created with a bit of help from W3school.
  * Quiz was created with the help of [Build a Quiz App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-quiz-app-with-html-css-and-javascript/).
  * End bit of main quiz page after user has answerd all the question help was taken from youtube channel [Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU-1X402kT-JlLdAitxSMA).

* ### Content
  * By making this project I had plenty of help from the [Slack Community](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/).

   * To make a color reference table in the readme, I used [readme.so](https://readme.so/editor).

   * I often look for help on the [StackOverflow community](https://stackoverflow.com/) when I get stuck as well

   *  When a user refreshes the page, the username input field stays focused. This was taken from [LOVE MATHS](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-maths-2.0-sourcecode)

   * The quiz questions and answers were taken from [GOAL Website](https://www.goal.com/en-us).
