## For UX
* In the body, I used an image of a football theme that matches well with the foreground color I chose, which is a mixture of these colors (#183153, #892be2) and you can find all the colors I used on the website below in the reference sectionðŸ‘‡.

## Credits
  I did not find HTML and CSS too challenging since I had some experience with them and received some assistance from Slack, tutor support and W3school. However, Javascript was quite challenging even though I was familiar with the basics of js before I joined the course. Still, I needed help from outside sources, such as YouTube and Udemy.
* ### JS Code
  * The quiz information overlay page was created with a bit of help from W3school.
  * Quiz questions and answers help was taken from [(Udemy) Build a Quiz App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-quiz-app-with-html-css-and-javascript/).
  * End bit of question and answer page after user has answer all the question help was taken from youtube [Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU-1X402kT-JlLdAitxSMA).

* ### Content
  * By making this project I had plenty of help from the [Slack Community](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/).

   * To make a color reference table in the readme, I used [readme.so](https://readme.so/editor).

   * I often look for help on the [StackOverflow community](https://stackoverflow.com/) when I get stuck as well

   *  When a user refreshes the page, the username input field stays focused. This was taken from [LOVE MATHS](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-maths-2.0-sourcecode)

   * The quiz questions and answers were taken from [GOAL](https://www.goal.com/en-us).



* ### Media
  * favicon logo was taken from [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=football+icon&tbm=isch&chips=q:football+icon,g_1:red:DzEFUJmS5D0%3D&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB959GB959&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjDz5LR2vX2AhV38LsIHZNoDN0Q4lYoB3oECAEQKg&biw=1519&bih=714#imgrc=V0k4UncPwJvZjM).
